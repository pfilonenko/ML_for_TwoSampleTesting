# About
This repository is a part of the paper addressed to solve the two-sample problem under right-censored observations using Machine Learning.

The problem statement can be formualted as $H_0: S_1(t) = S_2(t)$ vs $H: S_1(t) \neq S_2(t)$.


# Repository
This repository includes following parts:
- **DATASET** contains the C++ project for the dataset simulation and a fragment of resulting dataset. The full dataset can be downloaded at the Hugging Face (pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting/).
- **PROPOSED_ML_FOR_TWO_SAMPLE_TESTING** contains an python-project for the proposed methods. This implementation represents the end-to-end pipeline (from two right-censored samples to the $p$-value).
- **SUPPLEMENTARY_MATERIALS** contains results of the test power and percentage points for the proposed methods.

For this repository there is corresponding repository at the Hugging Face with full version of used datasets ([pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting/](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting)).

# Pipeline for the proposed two-sample methods
**TWO-SAMPLE TESTING VIA THE PROPOSED METHODS CONTAINS FOLLOWING STEPS:**
1) Select 2 samples with right-censored observations;
2) Compute test statistics of several classical two-sample tests;
3) Load test statistics into the proposed method;
4) Compute test statistic of the proposed method;
5) Compute corresponding $p$-value using the table of percentage points.

# Example

To run the proposed methods, you have to run the script **Example.py** in the folder:
> ML_for_TwoSampleTesting / proposed_ml_for_two_sample_testing / source /

To get there, click [here](https://github.com/pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting/tree/main/proposed_ml_for_two_sample_testing/source).
