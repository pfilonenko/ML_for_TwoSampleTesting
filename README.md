AUTHORS: PETR PHILONENKO, Ph.D. in Computer Science; SERGEY POSTOVALOV, D.Sc. in Computer Science


This repository includes following parts:
- **dataset** contains the C++ project for the dataset simulation and a fragment of resulting dataset. The full dataset can be downloaded at the Hugging Face (pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting/).
- **proposed_ml_for_two_sample_testing** contains an executiable python-project for the proposed methods.
- **supplementary_materials** contains results of the test power and percentage points for the proposed methods.
