TITLE: "Machine Learning for Two-Sample Testing under Right-Censored Data: A Simulation Study"

AUTHORS: 
- PETR PHILONENKO, Ph.D. in Computer Science;
- SERGEY POSTOVALOV, D.Sc. in Computer Science.

This repository includes following parts:
- **dataset** contains the C++ project for the dataset simulation and a fragment of resulting dataset. The full dataset can be downloaded at the Hugging Face (pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting/).
- **proposed_ml_for_two_sample_testing** contains an python-project for the proposed methods. This implemention allows to execute computation as end-to-end pipeline (from two right-censored samples to the p-value).
- **supplementary_materials** contains results of the test power and percentage points for the proposed methods.

For this reposetory there is corresponding reposetory at the Hugging Face with full version of used datasets ([pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting/](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pfilonenko/ML_for_TwoSampleTesting)).
